# Module 9 sql-challenge

## Acting as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, my first task was to complete a research project about the people employed by the company during the 1980's and 90's. 6 CSV files were provided to complete this task. The employee data was analyzed by importing the CSV's into PgAdmin and running SQL queries. 

## Steps for Completion
- Data Modeling
    - An ERD was created to establish the relationships for table creation
    - The employees table was identified as being needed as the primary key reference, which allowed all other tables to be linked.
- Data Engineering
    - PostgreSQL table schemas were created
    - CSV's corresponding to the appropriate tables were imported
- Data Analysis
    - SQL queries were created for answering specific business questions 
        - All employees were listed in specific departments
        - Managers were identified alongside their respective departments
        - Frequency counts of last names were counted to help understand naming patterns within the company
        - Employees were filtered using custom criteria like hire dates and names
